# How to use it!?

You can load the _1971.svg_ layout into the WASD custom key caps purchase page.

You **MUST** set the key colors manually when you order the caps.

Follow the preview image to match the key color layout. Note that all keys marked as Mint in the preview will be printed in a color close to WASD's dark purple ABS. The rest of the keys will be printed White.

If you want to match the 1976 colors more closely, you will need to edit the SVG, see below.

# I want to change some colors!

Sure thing, download [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/en/download/) and just change the colors on the layer named `design`.  It should not be necessary for me to say this, but I offer no warranty, or liability. This is an at your own risk type of deal.

There's a lot of other layers in there, any visible layer will be printed unless you specifically tell WASD not to. So I'd recommend you don't do that!

If you want more detailed instructions for using InkScape, please hunt around on Google for tutorials.

# Disclaimer

I accept no responsibility or provide any warranties, guarantees or assurances with this design. I mean, it should work just fine, and it looks pretty sweet, if you ask me! But, if you're expecting some sort of shared liability etc. you just forget that right now mister (or missy)

If you get it printed by WASD and things ain't right, or you just plain hate it, sorry, them's the breaks.

I will be getting a print of this set for myself, so hold on for the preview photos if you're easily spooked by non-existent/unproven product.

Sleep tight! :)

Oh and here's a nice picture by Scott Hansen (aka. ISO50, aka. Tycho.)
